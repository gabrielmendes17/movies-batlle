#### Projects Decisions
<p align="left">  
    üî≠ Application consumes movies data from external API so I made integration tests to avoid building manual mocks.
</p>
<p align="left">  
    üî≠ Given the approaches I had to make the requests in parallel, I chose to install the web flux dependency to use the WebClient and then make asynchronous calls in parallel in the same thread. In addition to that, this chosen approach is more memory and CPU efficient.

<p align="left">  
    üî≠ Given the approaches, I had to build movie combinations.<br />
    I chose an algorithm to create combinations with non-repetitions and then shuffle before saving combinations at the database when a user creates a new GameMatch.<br />
    In addition to that when users close a match the systems delete entire combinations from the database.
